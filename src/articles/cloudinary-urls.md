Using the images stored on cloudinary requires building a url. You could do it manually but of course that's not how we roll right ?

### pug
Pug is my favourate template renderer and this is a pretty good example of why. You can access the cloudinary api directly from within the template like so:

`img(src=cloudinary['images/coal-mine'].url({width:1600, height:800}))`

### handlebars
To pull the same stunt in handlebars you need a helper like [handlebars-cloudinary](https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/handlebars-cloudinary).

See handlebars-cloudinary readme for usage, or see it in action in `lib/plugins.js` but this helper will allow you to get cloudinary urls in handlebars like this:

`<img src="{{cloudinary 'images/coal-mine' '{width:1600, height:800, crop:"fill"}'}}"`

In this repo, layouts use a call like this to get a url for each page's cover. See it in `layouts/cleanBlog/header.hbs`.

### markdown
You can use a [marked-cloudinary](https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/marked-cloudinary) to include your cloudinary images in markdown too.

Again, see marked-cloudinary readme for usage, or see it in use in `lib/plugins.js`. You can generate images in your markdown like this:

`![image alt](cloudinary_id "image title { width: 400, height: 300, crop: \'fill\'}")`

It will render like this:

`<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/see-me-rollin/image/upload/c_fill,h_300,w_400/v1/images/coal-mine" alt="coal mine"> &quot;coal mine &quot;</p>`

Which, without additional styling, will look like this. The `&quot;` and `<p>` tag is normal marked behaviour. Of course you can modify the appearance with your own styling.

![coal mine](images/coal-mine "coal mine { width: 400, height: 300, crop: 'fill'}")

**Note:** the image above will be broken if you're viewing this in the git repo. Git will use it's own markdown engine to render this file, which of course doesn't include the `marked-cloudinary` renderer. If you want to see this in action, clone the repo, and build & serve locally.
